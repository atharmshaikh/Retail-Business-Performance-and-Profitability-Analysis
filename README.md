## 📦 Dataset Overview
The dataset is a transactional log of retail orders, containing:
- Product pricing (cost & list price)
- Discount percentages and quantities
- Date-wise order history
- Product categories, customer segments, and regional info

🗃 **Original CSV** → Cleaned using SQL queries → Exported as `retail_data.csv`

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Calculations (SQL)

We imported the dataset into **DB Browser for SQLite**, then removed nulls and created derived fields for analytical KPIs.

### 🔢 Key Calculated Fields
- `Revenue` = `Quantity * List Price`
- `Discount Amount` = `(List Price * Discount % / 100) * Quantity`
- `Selling Price` = `Revenue - Discount`
- `Cost Total` = `Quantity * Cost Price`
- `Profit` = `Selling Price - Cost Total`
- `Profit Margin` = `Profit / Revenue`

```sql
-- 1. View Cleaned Data
SELECT * FROM cleaned_orders;

-- 2. Top 10 Revenue Generating Products
SELECT product_id, SUM(actual_price) AS revenue
FROM cleaned_orders
GROUP BY product_id
ORDER BY revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 3. Top 5 Products by Region
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT region, product_id, SUM(actual_price) AS revenue
  FROM cleaned_orders
  GROUP BY region, product_id
)
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rn
  FROM cte
) a WHERE rn <= 5;

-- 4. Monthly Sales by Year
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, MONTH(order_date) AS order_month, SUM(actual_price) AS sales
  FROM cleaned_orders
  GROUP BY order_year, order_month
)
SELECT order_month,
  SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2022 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_22,
  SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2023 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_23
FROM cte
GROUP BY order_month
ORDER BY order_month;

-- 5. Highest Revenue Category (Monthly)
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT category, DATE_FORMAT(order_date, "%Y/%M") AS year_month, SUM(actual_price) AS revenue
  FROM cleaned_orders
  GROUP BY category, year_month
)
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rn
  FROM cte
) a WHERE rn = 1;

-- 6. Sub-Category Revenue Growth Comparison
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT sub_category, YEAR(order_date) AS order_year, SUM(actual_price) AS sales
  FROM cleaned_orders
  GROUP BY order_year, sub_category
),
cte2 AS (
  SELECT sub_category,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2022 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_22,
    SUM(CASE WHEN order_year = 2023 THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS sales_23
  FROM cte
  GROUP BY sub_category
)
SELECT *, 
  (sales_23 - sales_22) * 100.0 / sales_22 AS growth
FROM cte2
ORDER BY growth DESC;
